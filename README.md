OTP
100
hackerman is so dank that he decided to play around with OTPs.
he did the following:
message1 ^ key = cipher1
message2 ^ key = cipher2

He gives you cipher1 and cipher2 and challenges you to find the concatenation of messages 1 and 2.
Are you dank enough to find this?
Oh and also, 'meme' is so popular that hackerman used the word in both his messages.
cipher1 is '\x05F\x17\x12\x14\x18\x01\x0c\x0b4'
cipher2 is '>\x1f\x00\x14\n\x08\x07Q\n\x0e'
Both without quotes

I was told VigenÃ¨re Cipher is secure as long as length(key) == length(message). So I did just that!

Here is a file that would show you how one would normally implement DES. But we ain't normal, are we!? We are dank. So we decided to change stuff a little.
Great, now all you have to do is decrypt this! But ... but don't you need a key for that? Ah what a weakling. You're so weak that I decided I need a key that is just like you.
Enough clues? I guess. Oh by the way. I know I gave you a file which basically explains everything you got to do, but I'm afraid you're going to have to dig deeper if you want to last 'fewer rounds' with me in a boxing contest.
okay so now you have this, an encrypted message: [9, 135, 35, 24, 209, 134, 39, 37, 8, 215, 10, 106, 192, 93, 208, 218, 222, 6, 206, 141, 79, 56, 156, 122, 88, 44, 165, 220, 227, 211, 71, 5, 76, 18, 108, 1, 233, 116, 206, 181, 40, 37, 153, 113, 158, 160, 126, 148]
